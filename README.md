## About Alphabet Challenge

I designed and developed *Alphabet Challenge* as part of the **Swift Student Challenge 2025**, aiming to encourage users to explore their creativity through a gamified photography experience. The app invites users to find and photograph alphabet letters hidden in everyday scenes — turning their surroundings into a playful design hunt.

This project was completed **from idea to working code in just 20 days**, balancing visual design, feature scoping, and SwiftUI development within a tight timeline. Although I didn’t win in the end, I gained a tremendous amount of insight during the process — from solving real-world SwiftUI issues to learning how to scope and execute a full-featured project independently.

The experience is divided into two main sections: **Finding** and **Collection**.

### 🧭 Finding

In this section, users are guided to identify and photograph letters they haven’t yet collected. To support this, I created a sliding card interface with visual hints, powered by **SwiftUI’s advanced scrolling and animation capabilities**. This makes the interaction smooth, intuitive, and motivational. Each completed letter is celebrated with subtle animations to keep users engaged and encouraged.

### 📷 Live Camera Integration

Using **AVFoundation**, I implemented a live camera preview with zoom and high-quality capture features. This allows users to compose and take precise photos, which is essential for spotting letterforms in real-world scenes. The live preview was especially important for enhancing the immediacy and fun of the activity.

### 📚 Collection

Once users begin collecting letters, they can manage and sort their progress through themed "collections". I used **SwiftData** — a more intuitive alternative to CoreData — for persistent storage. It allows users to filter and review their captured alphabets even after closing the app, with minimal boilerplate code and strong integration with SwiftUI.

### 🖼️ Final Grid Export

I also integrated **PhotoUI** to support image selection and saving. When users complete a set, the app can stitch the 26-letter images into a single grid, which can then be exported — offering a tangible outcome and sense of accomplishment.

### 🤖 AI as a Development Partner

AI played a crucial role throughout development. It helped me:
- **Prioritise MVP features** to stay focused and avoid feature creep.
- **Understand cryptic error messages** and debug more confidently.
- **Spot simple mistakes** I might have otherwise overlooked.
- **Brainstorm motivational quotes**, which were surprisingly hard to source but important for reinforcing the app’s uplifting tone.

This project is part of my ongoing exploration into user-centered design and SwiftUI development. It challenged me to think holistically about interaction design, emotional engagement, and technical feasibility — all of which I’m excited to
